# The Autumn Parsing Library

## Autumn has moved to https://github.com/norswap/whimsy

## Legacy Versions

- **v1** - https://github.com/ncellar/autumn_v1

The initial version of Autumn is an extensible parser-combinator library built
upon the PEG formalism. It was the first general PEG parsing library to support
left recursion with both left- and right-associative interpretations. It also
includes support for precedence and associativity.

It was the object
of [a paper (Parsing Expression Grammars Made Practical)][SLE2015] at the SLE
(Software Language Engineering) in 2015.

- **v2** - https://github.com/ncellar/autumn_v2

v2 is a considerably simplified rewrite of v1 in the Kotlin programming
language.

It was the object of
[a paper (Taming Context-Sensitive Languages with Principled Stateful Parsing)][SLE2016] at
the SLE (Software Language Engineering) in 2016.
